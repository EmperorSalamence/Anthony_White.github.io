I called my stack class and referenced my average method from my Iris lab. I also imported the csv library in order to access the calculate_me file. I accessed the data as a list of lists so that it'd be easier to iterate through it and input it into my evaluate method. My evaluate method uses a stack in order to hold each of the elements that are numbers and then pops the top 2 elements off the top of the stack. It returns the value of the equation which is can store in a list that holds all of the results. I took the average and got 529.91. I used the eval method which allows for a string to be evaluated as a mathmatical function.
