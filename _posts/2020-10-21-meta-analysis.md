Study: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1075547004270234

I found a study that questions whether or not readers' perception of the validaty of scientific findings were influenced by how the findings are presented within main media. They tested if adding controversy and/or context to a news story about global warming influenced readers' belief in it's validaty. They studied 209 people who were asked to read a treatment and answer a questionnaire. The results show that in all cases, added information, whether content or controversy, made readers more certain about the validity of the data then if neither was present. The data the scientist used seem legitimate, but there is the question of what articles they used and what they consider context and controversy, as different articles may have different uses of both which may have not been equal. Their results logically make sense as additional information should increase belief in a certain claim or position. This article seems pretty immune to publish or perish as it doesn't seem like a study that is necessarily groundbreaking or thought changing, but more of reinforcement of a previously understood concept. The only aspect that might have been affected would be the sample size, as since it's pretty small it's a lot harder to extrapolate and get and accurate read on how larger groups of people would respond in the same scenario.
